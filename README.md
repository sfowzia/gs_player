# Gstreamer Player

This program uses the GStreamer library to play a video file from a path specified in the command-line when executing the program. The program creates a GStreamer pipeline using the playbin element, which automatically selects the appropriate decoding and playback elements based on the file type. The pipeline is started with the gst_element_set_state function, and the program waits for the playback to finish or for an error to occur using the gst_bus_timed_pop_filtered function. If an error occurs, the program parses the error message using the gst_message_parse_error function and outputs the error message and debugging information to the console.
